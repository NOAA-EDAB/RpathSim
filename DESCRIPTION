Description: This repository will house various Rpath models that have been 
  developed to test the performance of the model.  Rpath is a mass balance food
  web model based on Polovina 1984 and the popular Ecopath with Ecosim software.
  This is part of a larger project being run by the International Council for 
  the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) working group on multispecies assessment 
  methods (WGSAM).
